# Postfix Integration

This is a community developed integration designed to parse logs from [Postfix mail servers](https://www.postfix.org/). The plug-in supports 

## Compatibility
The `log` ingestion pipeline was tested with logs from Postfix version 3.8.6 running on Ubuntu 24. 

Currently this integration supports parsing logs from the Postfix anvil, cleanup, error, local, master, pickup, postfix-script, qmgr, scache, smtp, and smtpd processes with additional support for [OpenDKIM](http://www.opendkim.org/) and [policyd-spf](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/postfix-policyd-spf-python/policyd-spf.1.en.html).  All other events are dropped.

**Exported fields**
| Field | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| @timestamp | Date/time when the event originated. This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when the event was generated by the source. If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated by the first time the event was received by the pipeline. Required field for all events. | date |
| data_stream.dataset | Data stream dataset name.<br/> `postfix.log` | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.type | Data stream type.<br/> `logs` | constant_keyword |
| data_stream.namespace | A user defined namespace. Namespaces are useful to allow grouping of data. <br/><br/> Many users already organize their indices this way, and the data stream naming scheme now provides this best practice as a default. Many users will populate this field with `default`. If no value is used, it falls back to `default`.<br/><br/>Beyond the Elasticsearch index naming criteria noted above, namespace value has the additional restrictions:<br/><br/><ul><li>Must not contain -</li><li>No longer than 100 characters</li></ul> | constant_keyword |
| event.dataset | Name of the dataset.<br/>`postfix.log` | constant_keyword |
| input.type| Type of Filebeat input.<br/>`filestream`| keyword |
| log.file.path | Full path to the log file this event came from, including the file name. | keyword |
